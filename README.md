# Factory definitions for Java

Weekend project; didn't quite get far enough to be useful. Owes debts to factorygirl, factoryboy, etc.
# Goals

1. Construct domain objects simply, without having to worry about appropriate values
2. Make it easy to write factories
3. Allow for generation of sequences of different objects (preferably with a relatively declarative API)
